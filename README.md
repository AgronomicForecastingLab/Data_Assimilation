### Data Assimilation MSc Project

##Introduction
Data Assimilation (DA) is an uncertainty quantification technique used to reduce the error in  predictions combining forecasting data with real observation of the state. The most used techniques  for DA are Variational approaches and Kalman Filter.  However, due to its extremely high computational complexity, it is not possible to work with the full  physical domains and several proposals to reduce the complexity of the space have been proposed  and employed. In this project, we propose to use encoder-decoder technology to reduce the  computational cost of solving 3D Variational data assimilation. In particular, the space will be reduced  by applying E/D technologies to the background error covariance matrix.
