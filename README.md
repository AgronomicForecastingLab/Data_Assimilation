# Data Assimilation
### Introduction

Data Assimilation (DA) is an uncertainty quantification technique used to reduce the error in  predictions by combining forecasting data with observation of the state. The most common techniques for DA are Variational approaches and Kalman Filters.

In this work, I propose a method of using Autoencoders to model the Background error covariance matrix, to greatly reduce the computational cost of solving 3D Variational DA *while increasing the quality of the Data Assimilation*.
